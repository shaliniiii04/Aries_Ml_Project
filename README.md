# Aries_Ml_Project

The project aims to recommend travel areas to the users and help them plan their itinerary in the most efficient way as per their given timeline and preferences. 
The project uses Decision Tree Algorithm as a classifier in order to recommend travel areas to travelers. When a new user enters a requirement the decision tree will predict the best and most accurate location. 
Pre-processing techniques like: data cleaning, one-hot encoding have been used to eliminate empty or wrong values from the dataset.
 After cleaning  and transforming the data, we’ve used decision Tree Classifier method library and Random Tree Classifier Method by importing Sklearn library  to predict the most accurate location.
